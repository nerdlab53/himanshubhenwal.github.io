### Education

Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (2021-25)
- Bhagwan Parshuram Institute Of Technology, New Delhi

### **Personal Projects**

**Haiku Llama**

- A miniature version of Llama which generates Haiku for an input line
- Fine-Tuned a miniature Llama 2 on a custom dataset to generate a small Haiku from small line as input.
- The model is in continued development to make it better at text generation tasks and simultaneously continuing
  to improve the data to train the model further.
- Utilized Python, PyTorch, AutoTrain to fine-tune using PEFT and LoRA, and HuggingFace to host the model.

**Analysis and Prediction of Rain and Weather Trends in Australia**

- Analysed and predicted rain and the weather trends in Australia.
- Conducted comprehensive analysis and predictions of rain and weather trends in Australia using the Rains in Australia dataset from Kaggle achieving an accuracy of 85.6% using XgBoost.
- Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.

**Sign Language MNIST Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks**

- Used TensorFlow to create a classification model based on the Sign Language MNIST dataset on Kaggle
- Constructed a classification model by leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for the Sign Language MNIST dataset acquired from Kaggle.
- Employed Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas for model creation, implementation, and analysis.

**Sarcastic News Headline Classifier**

- Designed a classifier which classifies a news headline as sarcastic or not.
- Formulated a classifier with the capability to distinguish between sarcastic and non-sarcastic news headlines.
- The dataset encompassed a collection of 2000 instances comprising headlines along with their corresponding classification as either     sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
- Utilized Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas for building and evaluating the classifier.
